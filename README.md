# Linked List Implementation in C

This repository contains implementations of Linked Lists as part of my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C. Linked Lists are fundamental data structures that store data dynamically, making it easier to insert, delete, and traverse elements compared to arrays.

## Overview
A Linked List is a sequence of nodes where each node stores data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation, allowing easier manipulation of data, especially when frequent insertions or deletions are needed.

This repository includes various types of linked lists and the common operations performed on them. It serves as a hands-on learning resource for understanding how linked lists function.

## Features
- Single Linked List Implementation
- Basic Linked List operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, and Searching
- Efficient memory management
- Beginner-friendly code with comments

## Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the list.
2. **Doubly Linked List** (Coming soon): Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked List** (Coming soon): The last node of the list points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.

## Operations
### Singly Linked List
1. **Insertion**:
   - At the beginning
   - At the end
   - At a specific position
2. **Deletion**:
   - From the beginning
   - From the end
   - From a specific position
3. **Traversal**: Traverse and print all the elements of the linked list.
4. **Searching**: Search for an element in the linked list.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CoderRadhyashyam/Linked-List.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd Linked-List
```

## Usage
1. Compile the C code using a C compiler (like GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./linked_list
   ```
